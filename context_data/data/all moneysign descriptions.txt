1) Tactical Tiger: An acute awareness of their surroundings, combined with the ability to act with agility and swiftness, makes them perfectly capable of achieving difficult goals. They assert and maintain control over the outcome of a situation by keeping a watchful eye and never letting their guard down. They possess the optimal blend of strategical skills and emotional intelligence — they tend to be bold and risk-taking, while also being careful; they’re clever and tactful, patient and persistent, and they can also be zealous when required. They’re equipped to be self-sufficient owing to their robust decision-making, observant nature, and tendency to adapt easily to situations.
2) Enlightened Whale: When it comes to decision-making, they're a realist. They don't allow irrational sentiments to cloud their judgement. They can handle the pressures of working with tight deadlines and are unperturbed by situations that are beyond their control. While they are blessed with the gift of a sharp memory and a knack for tackling complex situations, they are usually modest about their intellectual prowess. They avoid making hasty decisions and prefer to give their undivided attention to things that matter. Their easy-going attitude towards life, coupled with a sense of self-awareness, allows them to maintain a calm disposition even when provoked. And they take care of themselves by blowing off some steam once in a while.
3) Persistent Horse: Being a creature of habit, they firmly believe in following a daily routine. They are often surrounded by a large social circle and prefer companionship over solitude. They take particular joy in being present in an environment that allows them to share and absorb ideas. They have the patience and perseverance to go the extra mile in order to achieve a goal.

In the pursuit of stability, they steer clear of situations that may be unpredictable or volatile.
4) Stealthy Shark: They prefer to maintain an air of mystery by being discreet about their intentions and taking measured actions. They're highly inquisitive and aren't afraid to venture into the unknown if the reward could prove worth it. This, combined with their strategic thought process, helps them achieve solid results. Their high levels of ambition can trigger restlessness but also motivate them to seek prospects beyond the ordinary. They exercise autonomy while making decisions, even as they closely monitor their competitor’s movements to scout for rewarding opportunities. When a lucrative proposition is on the table, their decisions are swift and deliberate, regardless of what the outcome may be.
5) Opportunistic Lion: They have a striking demeanor and a curious mind, which means they’re always on the lookout for the next big opportunity.

This helps them make the most of the options presented, even when the window of opportunity is narrow. They’ll do what it takes to emerge ahead of their competitors. Being highly self-motivated allows them to keep exploring new pursuits no matter what the outcome may be. While taking time off to celebrate a significant milestone is important to them, they will not think twice before jumping right back into action if there’s something exciting on the horizon.
6) Vigilant Turtle: They're an incredibly composed and grounded individual with a strong sense of self-control, which comes from being satisfied with their achievements. They firmly believe in working hard to achieve their goals and follow a very systematic and disciplined approach while solving problems across different facets of their life.

They’re extremely skilled at negotiating difficult situations by applying a watertight system of checks and balances that they’ve established over time. They’re careful and highly observant, which allows them to anticipate undesirable outcomes and prepare in advance. They believe in taking one step at a time, and that holds them in good stead
